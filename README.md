# restmud
A MUD engine with a RESTful core

## Note
This project is mostly idle. I have updated it because GitHub pointed
out that one of the dependencies had a security vulnerability. I very
much doubt that anybody is using this code. Just in case you stumble
across it and decide to make your mistakes in the same pattern that
I was making my mistakes in 2014, I leave you with a more modern
abandoned codebase.

## Dependencies
* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
